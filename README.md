# Attrition Explorer: Unveiling Insights with our Interactive Shiny App

Welcome to the Attrition and Clustering Dashboard project! This Shiny App aims to provide insights into employee attrition using clustering analysis.

Attrition can have significant implications for businesses, like high costs associated with finding replacements, increased difficulty to build and maintain a consistent company culture, loss of productivity, etc.

Understanding the factors that contribute to attrition is crucial for organizations to devise effective strategies for employee retention and talent management.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

-   **data**: The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors) and contains information about employee demographics, job characteristics, and specific factors that could impact attrition in an organization.
-   **notebooks**: The `app.R` file contains the main code that builds the Shiny App.
-   **utils**: The R file `shiny_functions.R` contains utility functions used throughout the project.
